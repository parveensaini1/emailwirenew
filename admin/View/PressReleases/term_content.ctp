We prefer prepayment with credit cards, but we also bill clients via invoicing. If you are a first-time user and intend to pay through invoicing, you must pay $99 fee, download and complete application form for approval. There is no fee to first-time users who intend to pay with credit cards. All account holders are responsible to pay their invoices upon receipt. We reserve the right to change prices at anytime without prior notification.</p>
<p>
Please note that, for editorial reasons, we cannot guarantee that editors and publishers will select your release for a story. It is at their discretion to pick a release that will make news. However, we do guarantee that we will deliver your press release to news media and make it live on Emailwire.com and GroupWeb.com Network. We also cannot gurantee that search engines will index your press release, because we have no control over the decisions they make to index web pages, press releases or other web documents.</p>
<p>
GROUPWEB.COM will charge a minimum of $59 per press release that has been approved and made live on Emailwire.com. If you have posted a press release on Emailwire.com, but you wish to withdraw it before it is approved, please notify our editors by calling 619-284-8011.</p>
